# Breeding Program for Maize Improvement

This is Skoltech Modern Plant Breeding Workshop final project 2023 

![][def]

## This repository is...

In this project, we aimed to analize the provided data and find the best lines for the further breeding.

## Conclusions

As the result we proposed breeding scheme for maize that includes DH lines obtaining, MET, genomic selection and CMS introduction.

![][def2]

We identified 5 highly promising DH lines for further corn hybrid production. Lines have one of the following traits: early vigor, early flowering, lodging resistance.

Obtained lines was evaluated in LineXtester analysis and show good performance.
